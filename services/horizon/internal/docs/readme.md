title: Horizon
---

Horizon is the server for the client facing API for the Kin ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [core](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/stellar-core) and applications that want to access the Kin network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc.

You can interact directly with Horizon via curl or a web browser but the Kin Foundation provides [SDKs](https://kin.org/developers/) for clients to use to interact with Horizon.

Kin Foundation runs an instance of Horizon that is connected to the test net [https://horizon-testnet.kininfrastructure.org/](https://horizon-testnet.kininfrastructure.org/).
